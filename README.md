# ReArt :art:

This personal project is in progress. The goal is to implement a collection of virtual exhibits of classical art. The site is powered by React and (at this point of progress) demonstrates command of the following skills:
 
-	React Router DOM
-	Galleries created with CSS Flex & Grid
-	Creation of interactive components such as an image slideshow without the use of a library

All art is of the public domain. This projected is inspired by the incredible free collection of many more exhibits at [Artvee]( https://artvee.com/). Artvee brings art, history, and culture to the homes of many without the barrier of an entry fee. I highly recommend visiting their website, but only after checking out my own of course :slightly_smiling_face:
