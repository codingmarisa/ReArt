    text: "Henrique Alvim Corrêa (1876-1910) was a Brazilian artist working in Belgium at the end of the 19th century, specialising in military and science fiction illustration. His best-known work is this illustrated French translation of H G Wells's The War of the Worlds, for which only 500 copies were produced. Three years later, The War of the Worlds was published in French, translated by Henry-D. Davray (1873-1944), an accomplished litterateur who specialized in the work of Wells, Kipling, Wilde, and Yeats. The translation was reprinted several times in the following years, but not issued with illustrations until 1906, when the Brazilian artist Henrique Alvim Corrêa took on the task.",
